# Networking Realtime & Scrolling Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Realtime Updates Not Showing in Connections Tab
**Problem**: When on the "Connected" tab of the networking page, new messages from other users didn't update the red dot/unread count in realtime. Updates only appeared after leaving the entire networking page.

**Root Cause**: The realtime subscription in `app/networking.tsx` was only set up once on mount and didn't re-establish when switching between tabs (discover/connected).

**Fix**: Modified the `useEffect` dependency array to include `activeTab`, ensuring the subscription is re-established whenever the user switches tabs. Also added more detailed logging to track subscription status.

**Files Changed**:
- `app/networking.tsx` (lines 142-217)

### 2. Unable to Scroll to See Older Messages
**Problem**: In the networking chat screen, users couldn't scroll up to see older messages. Only messages that fit on the screen were visible.

**Root Cause**: GiftedChat component wasn't configured with proper scroll properties and infinite scroll support.

**Fix**: Added the following GiftedChat props:
- `infiniteScroll={true}` - Enables infinite scrolling
- `loadEarlier={false}` - Disables the "Load Earlier" button (not needed with infinite scroll)
- Enhanced `listViewProps` with `scrollEnabled: true` and `nestedScrollEnabled: true`

**Files Changed**:
- `app/networking\chat\[id].tsx` (lines 321-447)

### 3. Enhanced Logging for Debugging
Added comprehensive logging throughout the message flow:
- Message count tracking in `mergeMessages` function
- Database fetch counts in `loadMessages`
- Detailed realtime event logging with sender info
- Unread count increment/decrement tracking

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Realtime Unread Updates While on Connections Tab
1. Open the app on Account A
2. Navigate to Networking â†’ Connected tab
3. On Account B, send a message to Account A
4. **Expected**: Red dot and unread count appear immediately on Account A's Connected tab without leaving the page
5. **Check logs**: Look for `[Networking] New message received` and `[Networking] Incrementing unread count`

### Test 2: Scrolling Through Message History
1. Open a networking chat with many messages (>10)
2. Scroll up to view older messages
3. **Expected**: All older messages are visible and scrollable
4. Send a new message
5. **Expected**: New message appears at bottom, older messages remain accessible by scrolling up
6. **Check logs**: Look for `[NetworkingChat] loadMessages: fetched X messages` and `mergeMessages: result count: X`

### Test 3: Tab Switching with Realtime
1. Open Networking page on Account A
2. Switch between "Discover" and "Connected" tabs
3. On Account B, send a message
4. **Expected**: Unread indicator updates regardless of which tab is active
5. **Check logs**: Look for `[Networking] Setting up realtime subscriptions for tab: discover/connected`

### Test 4: Read Status Updates
1. Account A has unread messages
2. Open the chat (red dot should clear immediately - optimistic update)
3. Close the chat and return to Networking page
4. **Expected**: Red dot stays cleared (messages were marked as read)
5. **Check logs**: Look for `[NetworkingChat] Marked X messages as read`

## Key Changes Summary

### `app/networking.tsx`
```typescript
// Before: useEffect([user?.id])
// After: useEffect([user?.id, activeTab])
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) return;
  
  console.log('[Networking] Setting up realtime subscriptions for tab:', activeTab);
  
  const channel = supabase
    .channel(`rt-networking-list-${activeTab}`) // Unique channel per tab
    // ... rest of subscription logic
  
  return () => {
    console.log('[Networking] Cleaning up realtime subscriptions for tab:', activeTab);
    supabase.removeChannel(channel);
  };
}, [user?.id, activeTab]); // Added activeTab dependency
```

### `app/networking\chat\[id].tsx`
```typescript
// Added to GiftedChat component
<GiftedChat
  messages={messages}
  infiniteScroll          // NEW: Enable infinite scrolling
  loadEarlier={false}     // NEW: Disable load earlier button
  listViewProps={{        // ENHANCED: Better scroll support
    keyboardShouldPersistTaps: 'always',
    scrollEnabled: true,
    nestedScrollEnabled: true,
  }}
  // ... rest of props
/>
```

## Debugging Tips

If issues persist, check the console logs for:

1. **Subscription Status**:
   - `[Networking] Subscription status: SUBSCRIBED` - Good
   - `[Networking] Subscription status: CLOSED` - Problem

2. **Message Counts**:
   - `[NetworkingChat] loadMessages: fetched X messages` - Should match DB count
   - `[NetworkingChat] mergeMessages: result count: X` - Should never decrease

3. **Realtime Events**:
   - `[Networking] New message received: <id>` - Confirms realtime is working
   - `[Networking] Incrementing unread count` - Confirms counter is updating

4. **Tab Switching**:
   - `[Networking] Setting up realtime subscriptions for tab: connected` - Confirms re-subscription

## Additional Notes

- The `mergeMessages` function ensures no message history is lost by using a Map to deduplicate by `_id`
- Optimistic unread clearing provides instant UI feedback when opening a chat
- `useFocusEffect` ensures unread counts refresh when returning to the networking page
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
