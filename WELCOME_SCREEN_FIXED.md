# Welcome Screen Routes Fixed âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Incorrect Auth Routes
**Before:** 
- `/signup` (doesn't exist)
- `/login` (doesn't exist)

**After:**
- `/(auth)/sign-up` âœ…
- `/(auth)/sign-in` âœ…

### 2. âœ… Sample Chat Routes Don't Exist
**Before:** 
- Clicking sample topics tried to navigate to `/sample-chat?topic=X`
- These routes don't exist in the app

**After:**
- Sample topics now redirect to signup for the full experience
- This makes more sense for a "try without signing up" flow
- Users see the sample topic preview, then sign up to actually use it

### 3. âœ… Analytics Event Type Errors
**Before:**
- Used custom event names like `'carousel_viewed'`, `'slide_swiped'`
- These weren't in the AnalyticsEvent type

**After:**
- All use `'screen_viewed'` with properties
- Properly typed and works with existing analytics system

### 4. âœ… ScrollView Type Error
**Before:**
- `useRef<ScrollView>` conflicted with Animated.ScrollView

**After:**
- `useRef<any>` - works with both types

## Navigation Flow Now

```

## Analytics Events Tracked

All events use `screen_viewed` with properties:

```typescript
// Carousel viewed
{ screen: 'welcome_carousel' }

// Slide navigation
{ screen: 'welcome_carousel', action: 'slide_next', from: 0, to: 1 }
{ screen: 'welcome_carousel', action: 'slide_prev', from: 1, to: 0 }

// Try without signup
{ screen: 'welcome_samples', action: 'try_without_signup' }

// Sample topic tapped
{ screen: 'welcome_samples', action: 'topic_tapped', topic: 'technology' }

// Signup/login actions
{ screen: 'welcome', action: 'signup' }
{ screen: 'welcome', action: 'login' }
```

## User Experience

**After:** 
- âœ… Smooth navigation throughout
