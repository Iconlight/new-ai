# APK Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Auto-Logout After Some Time
**Problem:** App was logging users out unexpectedly after some time when using the APK build.

**Root Cause:** 
- SecureStore adapter wasn't properly handling async operations
- Missing error handling for session refresh failures
- No logging for auth state changes to debug issues

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated `src/services/supabase.ts`:
  - Made all SecureStore adapter methods properly async with `async/await`
  - Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
  - Added auth state change listener to log session refresh events
  - Prevents session loss by gracefully handling storage errors

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Mixed sync/async without error handling
getItem: (key: string) => SecureStore.getItemAsync(key)

// After: Proper async with error handling
getItem: async (key: string) => {
  try {
    const value = await SecureStore.getItemAsync(key);
    return value;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[Storage] Error getting item:', key, error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

### 2. ✅ Header Blocked by Notification Bar/Camera Notch
**Problem:** On the discovery page (and other screens), the header section was too high and blocked by the phone's notification bar and camera notch.

**Root Cause:**
- Fixed `paddingTop` values (60px, 8px) didn't account for device-specific safe areas
- Different phones have different status bar heights and notch sizes

**Solution Applied:**
- Integrated `useSafeAreaInsets` from `react-native-safe-area-context`
- **Removed `SafeAreaView`** which was conflicting with manual insets
- Applied dynamic padding based on device safe area insets with `Math.max(insets.top, 40) + 12`
- This ensures minimum padding on all devices and proper spacing below notch/status bar
- Fixed across all affected screens:
  - ✅ `app/discover.tsx` - Main discovery page header
  - ✅ `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Profile page header  
  - ✅ `app/(tabs)/explore.tsx` - Explore page header
  - ✅ `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Chats page header

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: SafeAreaView with fixed padding (conflicts/blocked by notch)
<SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
  <View style={styles.floatingHeader}>
// styles: paddingTop: 8

// After: Regular View with dynamic padding (properly respects notch)
<View style={styles.container}>
  <View style={[styles.floatingHeader, { paddingTop: Math.max(insets.top, 40) + 12 }]}>
// Uses Math.max to ensure minimum padding even on devices without notch
// Removed SafeAreaView to avoid conflicts with manual insets
```

## Testing Checklist

### Session Persistence Testing
- [ ] Install fresh APK build
- [ ] Sign in to the app
- [ ] Leave app in background for 1+ hours
- [ ] Return to app - should still be logged in
- [ ] Check console logs for `[Supabase] Session token refreshed successfully`
- [ ] Force close app and reopen - should still be logged in

### Header Positioning Testing
Test on multiple devices with different screen configurations:
- [ ] **Device with notch** (iPhone X and later, modern Android)
  - Open discovery page
  - Verify menu button (☰) is fully visible below notch
  - Verify "ProactiveAI" title is not obscured
  - Verify networking and profile icons are fully visible
  
- [ ] **Device without notch** (older phones)
  - Open discovery page
  - Verify header has proper spacing from status bar
  
- [ ] **Profile page**
  - Navigate to profile
  - Verify "Profile" header is not blocked by status bar/notch
  
- [ ] **Explore page** (if still used)
  - Navigate to explore tab
  - Verify "Today's Conversations" header is visible

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/services/supabase.ts` - Session persistence improvements
2. `app/discover.tsx` - Safe area insets for header
3. `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Safe area insets for header
4. `app/(tabs)/explore.tsx` - Safe area insets for header
5. `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Safe area insets for header

### Dependencies Used
- `expo-secure-store` - Secure session storage (existing)
- `react-native-safe-area-context` v5.6.0 (already installed)

## Build & Deploy

To test these fixes:
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
npm install

# Build new APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Or for local testing
npm run android
```

## Monitoring

After deploying, monitor these logs:
- `[Storage] Error getting/setting item:` - Should not appear unless actual storage issues
- `[Supabase] Session token refreshed successfully` - Should appear periodically
- `[Supabase] Session lost unexpectedly` - Should NEVER appear (would indicate a bug)

## Notes
- The safe area insets automatically adapt to different screen configurations
- Session tokens will refresh automatically before expiration
- Storage errors are now logged but won't crash the app or force logout
