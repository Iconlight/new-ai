## âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Foundation (Analytics & Database)
- **Analytics Service** (`src/services/analytics.ts`)
  - Event tracking for all user interactions
  - Automatic batching and flushing
  - Support for topic, conversation, match, and app events
  
- **Database Migrations** (`src/database/migrations/`)
  - `add_analytics_events.sql` - Event tracking table
  - `add_engagement_features.sql` - All engagement tables:
    - saved_topics
    - topic_reactions  
    - hidden_topics
    - conversation_insights
    - match_ratings
    - user_referrals
    - user_streaks

- **Topic Engagement Service** (`src/services/topicEngagement.ts`)
  - Like/unlike topics
  - Save/unsave topics
  - Hide topics or entire categories
  - Get user preferences based on reactions
  - Check saved/liked status

### Phase 2: Topic Actions UI (IN PROGRESS)
- **TopicCard Component** (`components/TopicCard.tsx`)
  - Interactive action buttons: Like, Save, Share, Hide
  - Optimistic UI updates
  - Visual feedback for liked/saved state
  
- **Discovery Screen Updates** (`app/discover.tsx`)
  - Integrated TopicCard component
  - Handler functions for all topic actions
  - Optimistic state management
  - Real-time sync with backend

## ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Run database migrations**
   - Execute the SQL files in Supabase dashboard
   - Verify tables are created properly
   
2. **Create Saved Topics Screen**
   - New file: `app/saved-topics.tsx`
   - List all saved topics
   - Allow opening and unsaving

3. **Add Analytics Tracking**
   - Integrate analytics.track() calls throughout the app
   - Track topic opens, conversation starts, etc.

### This Week
4. **Conversation Insights**
   - Service to generate AI summaries of conversations
   - Post-conversation modal with key takeaways
   - Actions: Save, Share, Find Related

5. **Better AI Responses**
   - Add action buttons below AI messages
   - Limit response length with expand/collapse

6. **Networking Education**
   - First-time modal explaining the feature
   - Progress indicator for unlocking matches
   - Enhanced match cards with "why" explanations

## ðŸš§ BLOCKERS / NOTES

- Sharing functionality uses basic text sharing - can be enhanced with custom images
- Analytics events queue in memory - will flush on app close but could lose events on crash
- Consider adding Sentry or similar for production error tracking

## ðŸ“Š METRICS TO START TRACKING

Once analytics is live, prioritize tracking:
1. **Topic engagement**: Open rate, like rate, save rate
2. **Conversation quality**: Messages per chat, conversation duration
3. **Match success**: Acceptance rate, first message rate
4. **Retention**: DAU, WAU, MAU, cohort retention

## ðŸ’¡ QUICK WINS

Low-effort, high-impact items to ship immediately:
- Toast notifications when user likes/saves (instant feedback)
- Loading skeletons for saved topics screen
- Haptic feedback on button presses
- Share count/view count on topics (social proof)
