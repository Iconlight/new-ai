# Bugs Fixed & Features Added - Complete Report

## 🐛 BUGS FIXED

### 1. ✅ Google Sign-In with PKCE
**Problem**: "Failed to get access token from Google" error after switching to PKCE flow.

**Solution**: Added support for authorization code exchange in addition to implicit flow.

**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Now checks for `code` parameter (PKCE flow)
- Calls `exchangeCodeForSession()` for PKCE
- Falls back to implicit flow if needed
- Better error logging

### 2. ✅ Likes/Saves Don't Persist After Refresh
**Problem**: User likes and saves disappeared when refreshing the discover screen.

**Solution**: Load user's liked and saved topics from database on screen load.

**File**: `app/discover.tsx`
- Added `loadUserEngagement()` function
- Queries `topic_reactions` and `saved_topics` tables
- Loads state before displaying topics
- Happens automatically on screen focus

### 3. ✅ No Route to Saved Items in UI
**Problem**: Users couldn't navigate to saved topics screen.

**Solution**: Added bookmark button in discover screen header.

**Files**: `app/discover.tsx`, `app\_layout.tsx`
- Bookmark icon button in header
- Shows count badge with number of saved items
- Navigates to `/saved-topics`
- Badge updates in real-time

### 4. ✅ Onboarding Flow Not Showing After Sign Out
**Problem**: App went to auth screen instead of welcome screen after logout.

**Solution**: Redirect guests to welcome screen instead of auth.

**Files**: `app/index.tsx`, `app\_layout.tsx`
- Changed redirect from `/(auth)` to `/welcome`
- Added welcome screen to navigation stack
- Added saved-topics to navigation stack
- Proper flow: signout → welcome → signup/login
