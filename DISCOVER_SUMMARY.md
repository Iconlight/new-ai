# Discover Page - Quick Summary

## What Changed

### ✅ Skeleton Loading Implemented
- Created `components/ui/TopicSkeleton.tsx` with shimmer animation
- Replaced "No topics available" message with 6 animated skeleton cards during loading
- Better UX - users see immediate feedback instead of blank screen

### Before
```
[Loading...] → "No topics available, pull to refresh"
```

### After
```
[Loading...] → [Animated skeleton cards] → Real topics
```

## Data Sources Being Used

### 1. **NewsAPI** (Primary)
- **URL**: https://newsapi.org/v2
- **Free Tier**: 100 requests/day
- **Categories**: Technology, Science, Business, Health, Entertainment, Sports
- **Setup**: Add `EXPO_PUBLIC_NEWS_API_KEY` to `.env`

### 2. **RSS Feeds** (Automatic Fallback)
When NewsAPI is unavailable or rate-limited:
- **BBC News** (Technology, Science, Business, Health, Entertainment, World)
- **CNET** (Technology)
- **Wired** (Technology)
- **TechCrunch** (Technology)
- **TIME** (General news)

### 3. **Database Cache**
- 30-minute cache to reduce API calls
- Offline access to previously fetched news

## How It Works

```
1. User opens Discover
   ↓
2. Show skeleton loading (6 animated cards)
   ↓
3. Fetch news from NewsAPI or RSS feeds
   ↓
4. AI generates conversation starters
   ↓
5. Display real topics (skeleton disappears)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`app/discover.tsx`**
   - Added `TopicSkeleton` import
   - Added skeleton loading when `loading === true`
   - Shows 6 skeletons alternating left/right

2. **`components/ui/TopicSkeleton.tsx`** (NEW)
   - Animated skeleton component
   - Shimmer effect (opacity animation)
   - Matches real topic card layout

## Files Created

1. **`DISCOVER_DATA_SOURCES.md`** - Complete technical documentation
2. **`components/ui/TopicSkeleton.tsx`** - Skeleton loading component

## Testing

### Test Skeleton Loading
1. Open app
2. Navigate to Discover tab
3. You should see 6 animated skeleton cards
4. After ~2 seconds, real topics appear

### Test Pull-to-Refresh
1. Pull down on Discover page
2. Skeleton loading appears
3. Fresh topics load from internet

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to improve the news quality:

1. **Get NewsAPI Key** (Free)
   ```bash
   # Visit https://newsapi.org/
   # Sign up and get API key
   # Add to .env:
   EXPO_PUBLIC_NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. **Rebuild app** to include new env variable

Without NewsAPI key, the app automatically uses RSS feeds (which work fine but may be slower).

## Summary

✅ **Skeleton loading** - Better UX during initial load
✅ **Multiple data sources** - NewsAPI + RSS feeds
✅ **Automatic fallback** - Never fails to load news
✅ **30-min cache** - Fast subsequent loads
✅ **Pull-to-refresh** - Get fresh content anytime

The Discover page now has professional skeleton loading instead of showing "No topics available"!
