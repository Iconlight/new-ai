# ðŸš€ ProactiveAI Networking - Production Checklist

## âœ… Database Setup

- [ ] Run `add_networking_tables.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Run `fix_networking_rls_policies.sql` immediately after
- [ ] Verify all 6 networking tables exist
- [ ] Test INSERT permissions with authenticated user
- [ ] Enable pgcrypto extension if using `gen_random_uuid()`

## âœ… Environment Configuration

- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` configured
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` configured  
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` configured and valid
- [ ] Test API connectivity from app

## âœ… Core Functionality

- [ ] User can enable networking without errors
- [ ] Settings page loads and saves preferences
- [ ] Interest management works (add/remove interests)
- [ ] Conversation analysis runs without errors
- [ ] Match finding works with multiple test users
- [ ] Match acceptance creates conversations
- [ ] Networking chat interface functional

## âœ… Navigation & UI

- [ ] All profile page links work (`/settings`, `/interests`, `/notifications`)
- [ ] Networking settings accessible and functional
- [ ] Error boundaries prevent app crashes
- [ ] Loading states show during async operations
- [ ] Success/error alerts provide user feedback

## âœ… Error Handling

- [ ] Network connectivity issues handled gracefully
- [ ] API rate limits handled with fallbacks
- [ ] Database errors show user-friendly messages
- [ ] Missing data scenarios handled (no interests, no messages)
- [ ] Permission errors guide users to solutions

## âœ… Privacy & Security

- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access
- [ ] User can disable networking anytime
- [ ] Conversation patterns anonymized appropriately
- [ ] Block list functionality works
- [ ] Visibility settings respected in matching

## âœ… Performance

- [ ] Conversation analysis doesn't block UI
- [ ] Match queries use proper database indexes
- [ ] Large user bases handled efficiently
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for mobile
- [ ] Network requests minimized and cached

## âœ… User Experience

- [ ] Onboarding explains networking clearly
- [ ] Privacy-first messaging throughout
- [ ] Compatibility scores make sense to users
- [ ] Conversation starters are relevant and engaging
- [ ] Match reasons are clear and helpful

## âœ… Testing Scenarios

### Single User
- [ ] Enable networking â†’ should work without errors
- [ ] Configure settings â†’ should persist to database
- [ ] Find matches â†’ should show "no matches" gracefully
- [ ] Disable networking â†’ should hide from other users

### Multiple Users
- [ ] Both users enable networking
- [ ] Both have conversation history with AI
- [ ] Both have overlapping interests
- [ ] Match generation finds compatible users
- [ ] Compatibility scores calculated correctly
- [ ] Accept match â†’ creates conversation
- [ ] Decline match â†’ removes from list
- [ ] Chat messages send/receive properly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] New user with no conversation history
- [ ] User with no interests selected
- [ ] Network connectivity loss during operations
- [ ] API rate limit exceeded
- [ ] Database temporarily unavailable

## âœ… Monitoring & Analytics

- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] User adoption metrics tracked
- [ ] Match success rates monitored
- [ ] Conversation quality metrics available
- [ ] Performance metrics collected

## âœ… Documentation

- [ ] Setup guide available for developers
- [ ] User privacy policy updated
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide created
- [ ] Feature walkthrough documented

## ðŸš¨ Pre-Launch Critical Items

1. **Database Security**: Verify RLS policies prevent data leaks
2. **API Keys**: Ensure production keys are secure and not exposed
3. **Error Handling**: Test all failure scenarios thoroughly
4. **User Privacy**: Confirm users understand and consent to networking
5. **Performance**: Test with realistic user loads

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics to Track

### Adoption
- % of users who enable networking
- Time from signup to networking enable
- Settings configuration completion rate

### Engagement  
- Matches accepted vs declined ratio
- Messages sent in networking conversations
- Repeat interactions between matched users
- User retention after first match

### Quality
- Average compatibility scores of accepted matches
- Conversation length and depth
- User satisfaction surveys
- Feature usage patterns

## ðŸ”„ Post-Launch Monitoring

### Week 1
- Monitor error rates and crash reports
- Track user adoption and drop-off points
- Collect initial user feedback
- Adjust matching algorithm if needed

### Month 1
- Analyze match success patterns
- Optimize conversation analysis accuracy
- Expand interest categories based on usage
- Plan feature enhancements

### Ongoing
- A/B test matching algorithm improvements
- Monitor for spam or abuse patterns
- Scale infrastructure as user base grows
- Iterate based on user behavior data
