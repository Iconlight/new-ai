// Add IconButton in header:
<IconButton
  icon="bookmark-multiple"
  iconColor="#FFFFFF"
  onPress={() => router.push('/saved-topics')}
/>

- ‚úÖ Signup from welcome
- ‚úÖ Login from welcome

### Data Available for Analysis
Once users start interacting, you'll have data for:
- Topic engagement rates by category
- Drop-off points in conversations
- Match acceptance patterns
- Feature usage metrics
- User preferences and patterns

## üé® UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS MADE

### Topic Cards
- **Before**: Simple card with just title and message
- **After**: 
  - Like button (heart) with red highlight
  - Save button (bookmark) with purple highlight
  - Share button (share icon)
  - Hide button (x icon) with category hide option
  - All actions have optimistic UI (instant feedback)
  - Buttons properly aligned in row

### Discovery Feed
- **Before**: Static topics, no interaction beyond opening
- **After**:
  - Like topics to influence recommendations
  - Save topics for later reading
  - Share interesting topics
  - Hide topics or entire categories
  - All actions tracked for personalization

### New Screens
- **Welcome Screen**: Professional onboarding with value props
- **Saved Topics Screen**: Organized list with status indicators

## üí° IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

### Adding Analytics
Sprinkle these throughout your existing screens:

```typescript
import { analytics } from '../src/services/analytics';

// Track screen views
analytics.trackScreenViewed(user?.id || '', 'screen_name');

// Track actions
analytics.trackTopicOpened(user.id, topicId, category);
analytics.trackMessageSent(user.id, chatId, messageLength);
analytics.trackMatchAccepted(user.id, matchId, compatibilityScore);
```

### Optimistic UI Pattern
All new features use this pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Update UI immediately
setLikedTopics(prev => new Set([...prev, topicId]));

// 2. Sync with backend
await reactToTopic(userId, topicId);

// 3. Rollback on error (optional)
if (error) {
  setLikedTopics(prev => {
    const next = new Set(prev);
    next.delete(topicId);
    return next;
  });
}
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Database migrations successful
- [ ] Welcome screen navigable
- [ ] Sample topics clickable
- [ ] Topic actions work (like, save, share, hide)
- [ ] Saved topics screen shows saved items
- [ ] Analytics events being recorded
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Smooth animations
- [ ] Works on both iOS and Android

## üö® MIGRATION NOTES

### Breaking Changes
None - all new features are additive

### Dependencies
Make sure you have:
- `expo-sharing` (for share functionality)
- `react-native-reanimated` (for welcome carousel)
- `expo-notifications` (for future notification features)

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables needed for current features

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

Track these to measure impact:

### Onboarding
- % who complete welcome carousel
- % who try sample topics
- Signup conversion from welcome vs direct

### Engagement
- Topic like rate
- Topic save rate
- Topics saved vs actually opened
- Share rate

### Retention
- DAU/MAU ratio
- Topics opened per session
- Time spent per conversation
- Return rate after saving topics

## üéØ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

When you're ready to continue, implement in this order:

1. **Conversation Outcomes** (Highest impact on engagement)
   - Users need to know "what's next" after a chat
   - Builds habit loop
   
2. **Better AI Responses** (Highest impact on satisfaction)
   - Current wall-of-text kills mobile UX
   - Quick wins with prompt changes

3. **Networking Education** (Unblocks main differentiator)
   - Users don't understand the feature
   - Clear communication = more usage

4. **Push Notifications** (Highest impact on retention)
   - Out of sight = out of mind
   - Daily habit formation
