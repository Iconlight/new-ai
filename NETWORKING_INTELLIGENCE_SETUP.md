# Networking Intelligence Feature - Setup Guide

## Overview

The "Ask AI About Them" feature allows users to chat with AI about potential networking matches before connecting. AI analyzes conversation patterns and provides insights while maintaining privacy.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- **Table**: `networking_intelligence_chats`
- **Privacy Settings**: Added to `user_networking_preferences`
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20240114_create_networking_intelligence.sql`

### 2. Service Layer ✅
- **File**: `src/services/networkingIntelligence.ts`
- **Functions**:
  - `getOrCreateIntelligenceChat()` - Get or create chat session
  - `askAboutUser()` - Send question to AI
  - `getIntelligenceChatMessages()` - Load chat history
  - `deleteIntelligenceChat()` - Clean up chat

### 3. UI Components ✅
- **Screen**: `app/networking/intelligence/[matchId].tsx`
- **Integration**: Updated `app/networking.tsx` with "Ask AI About Them" button

---

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User sees a match** on the Networking page
2. **Clicks "Ask AI About Them"** button
3. **Opens AI chat interface** dedicated to that person
4. **Asks questions** like:
   - "What topics have they been exploring?"
   - "What's their perspective on AI ethics?"
   - "Do they prefer deep or casual conversations?"
5. **AI responds** with insights based on:
   - Conversation patterns
   - Communication style
   - Interests and topics discussed
   - Message depth and frequency
6. **User decides** whether to connect

### AI Analysis

AI has access to:
- ✅ Communication style (analytical, creative, etc.)
- ✅ Curiosity level and question frequency
- ✅ Topic preferences and interests
- ✅ Conversation themes (summarized)
- ✅ Message depth patterns

AI does NOT reveal:
- ❌ Exact message quotes
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Emotional/vulnerable content
- ❌ Specific conversation details

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Apply the migration to create tables
supabase db push

# Or manually run the SQL file
psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d your-db -f supabase/migrations/20240114_create_networking_intelligence.sql
```

### 2. Verify Tables Created

```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT * FROM networking_intelligence_chats LIMIT 1;

-- Check privacy settings columns
SELECT allow_intelligence_analysis, intelligence_detail_level 
FROM user_networking_preferences 
LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. Test the Feature

1. Enable networking for 2+ test users
2. Create matches between them
3. Click "Ask AI About Them" on a pending match
4. Ask questions in the AI chat
5. Verify AI responses are relevant and privacy-preserving

---

## Privacy Controls

### User Opt-Out

Users can disable intelligence analysis:

```sql
UPDATE user_networking_preferences
SET allow_intelligence_analysis = false
WHERE user_id = 'user-id-here';
```

When opted out, AI will respond:
> "This user has opted out of intelligence analysis. You can still connect with them directly to learn more!"

### Detail Levels

- **basic**: High-level insights only
- **detailed**: Comprehensive analysis (default)

---

## Sample Conversations

### Example 1: Topic Exploration

```
User: What topics has Sarah been into lately?

AI: Sarah has been particularly engaged with AI ethics, 
especially around bias in algorithms. They've also explored 
philosophy of mind and consciousness questions. Recently, 
they've shown interest in climate tech solutions.
```

### Example 2: Communication Style

```
User: Do they prefer deep conversations or casual chat?

AI: Definitely deep conversations. Sarah's messages average 
180 characters and they ask questions in about 65% of their 
exchanges. They enjoy exploring ideas thoroughly rather than 
surface-level discussion.
```

### Example 3: Compatibility Check

```
User: Would we have good conversations about tech ethics?

AI: Absolutely! You both share strong interest in technology 
and ethics. Your analytical style would complement Sarah's 
philosophical approach well. They'd likely appreciate your 
structured thinking while bringing creative angles you might 
not consider.
```

## Technical Details

### Message Analysis

AI analyzes:
- **Question frequency**: How often they ask questions
- **Message length**: Average characters per message
- **Topic keywords**: Detected themes in conversations
- **Communication patterns**: Style indicators (philosophical, empathetic, etc.)

### Context Building

For each question, AI receives:
```typescript
{
  communicationStyle: 'philosophical',
  curiosityLevel: 85,
  topicDepth: 78,
  interests: ['technology', 'philosophy', 'science'],
  recentThemes: 'AI ethics, consciousness, climate tech',
  conversationInsights: 'Asks many questions, prefers detailed discussions'
}
```

### Privacy Boundaries

AI system prompt includes:
- Don't quote exact messages
- Summarize themes, not specifics
- No personal/identifying information
- Focus on intellectual interests
- Redirect private questions to direct connection

---

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Track Success

```sql
-- Intelligence chat usage
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_chats,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM networking_intelligence_chats;

-- Average questions per chat
SELECT AVG(jsonb_array_length(messages) / 2) as avg_questions
FROM networking_intelligence_chats;

-- Conversion: Intelligence chat → Connection
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 END) as connections,
  COUNT(*) as total_matches
FROM user_matches um
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM networking_intelligence_chats nic
  WHERE nic.match_id = um.id
);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI responses are generic

**Solution**: Ensure users have conversation history. New users with no messages will get limited insights.

### Issue: Chat not loading

**Check**:
1. Match ID is valid
2. User has permission to view match
3. RLS policies are correct

```sql
-- Test RLS
SELECT * FROM networking_intelligence_chats
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

### Issue: Privacy concerns

**Verify**:
1. AI never quotes exact messages
2. Personal info is filtered
3. Opt-out setting works

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Ideas

1. **Conversation Starters**: AI suggests ice-breaker topics
2. **Compatibility Predictions**: "You'll likely enjoy discussing X"
3. **Question Suggestions**: Auto-suggest relevant questions
4. **Learning**: Improve insights based on successful connections
5. **Voice Mode**: Ask questions via voice input

### Advanced Features

- **Comparative Analysis**: "How do we differ in our approaches?"
- **Debate Prediction**: "What might we disagree on?"
- **Growth Opportunities**: "What could I learn from them?"

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20240114_create_networking_intelligence.sql`
- ✅ `src/services/networkingIntelligence.ts`
- ✅ `app/networking/intelligence/[matchId].tsx`

### Modified Files

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with real user data
2. **Monitor AI responses** for quality and privacy
3. **Gather feedback** from beta users
4. **Iterate** on AI prompts based on usage
5. **Add analytics** to track feature adoption

---
