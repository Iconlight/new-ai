## 🚀 HOW TO DEPLOY

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations (10 minutes)
Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run these files in order:

```sql
1. src/database/migrations/add_analytics_events.sql
2. src/database/migrations/add_engagement_features.sql  
3. src/database/migrations/add_onboarding_progress.sql
```

### Step 2: Update Your Navigation (5 minutes)
Add routes to your app:

```typescript
// In your router config:
- /welcome → Welcome screen (for new users)
- /saved-topics → Saved topics screen
- Link from discover screen header to saved topics
```

### Step 3: Integrate Conversation Outcomes (10 minutes)
In your chat screen (`app/(tabs)/chat/[id].tsx`):

```typescript
import ConversationOutcomeModal from '../../../components/ConversationOutcomeModal';
import { shouldShowInsights } from '../../../src/services/conversationInsights';

// Add state
const [showOutcomeModal, setShowOutcomeModal] = useState(false);

// Check when to show (10+ messages or user navigating away)
useEffect(() => {
  if (messages.length >= 10) {
    setShowOutcomeModal(true);
  }
}, [messages.length]);

// Or on back button press
const handleBackPress = () => {
  if (shouldShowInsights(messages.length, true)) {
    setShowOutcomeModal(true);
  } else {
    router.back();
  }
};

// Add modal to render
<ConversationOutcomeModal
  visible={showOutcomeModal}
  onDismiss={() => {
    setShowOutcomeModal(false);
    router.back();
  }}
  chatId={chatId}
  userId={user?.id || ''}
  chatTitle={chat?.title || 'Conversation'}
/>
```

   - Requires OpenAI API (costs apply)
   - May take 5-10 seconds to generate
   - Fallback insights if API fails

2. **Analytics**
   - Events stored locally until flushed
   - Could lose data on app crash
   - Consider adding Sentry for production

3. **Saved Topics**
   - No sync between devices yet
   - No folders/organization
   - Could add tags later
